### About the Project

The idea behind this repo is a simple way to guarantee that you'll always able to connect to you [PiVPN](https://www.pivpn.io) even if your internet provider changes you public IP. By sending a notification via e-mail and/or Telegram whenever the IP of you Raspberry Pi changes, you'll never be left out of your home internet!

The system is a very simple python script that uses [amazon AWS](https://checkip.amazonaws.com) to get the current IPv4 Address of the device (must be running in the same machine as the VPN) it's running in.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

To maximize compatbility, you will only need [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and docker-compose to be installed on your computer. But if you wish to not run it as a container, feel free to check [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file and run it as a separate service, just `cd` into the [src](/src) folder and run `python3 run.py`. Make sure to edit the `run.py` file and set your own variables.

For the notifications, you will need an e-mail to be used as the "notificator" as well as a configured Telegram Bot. Remember to allow less secure apps on the e-mail end. For the Telegram Bot, you'll need 2 things: the Chat ID of the people that will receive the
notification, as well as the bot ID. You can learn about them [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots).

#### Instalation

Since the script is containerized, just run `git pull https://github.com/LombardiDaniel/ip-checker`, `cd ip-checker`. Create a `.env` file with the variables described below.

### Usage

The only configuration needed is to set the environment variables in the `.env` file. Configure your email and/or Telegram key in the `.env` file (separate multiple addresses by using `,`) and run `docker-compose up -d`. It logs to `stdout`, so you can easily check the logs via [portainer](https://www.portainer.io).
